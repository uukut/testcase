This is a README.txt. Please read this before using the TranSwap website to Add Liquidity or Swap Tokens.

First, it is better to log in to your Metamask before going into the website since it may not recognize your Metamask immediately if you use the connect Metamask button to connect Metamask and will cause error in transition afterward.
Second, try to add the pool and swap the token once before using the website since there may not have the ratio of the tokens or some other related issue. 
Third, try to use a small amount of tbnb inside the Add Liquidity and Swap Tokens like 0.0001, which is fine for every one of the tokens to add liquidity or swap.
Last, but not least, make sure that your pool has enough tokens for you to swap, otherwise, the gas will be out of range.
Finally, do not try to refresh the website since I change the domain of the website. Once you do so, GitHub cannot recognize it and turn to a 404 not found page.
That's all tips for using this website.
